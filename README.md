# Robust-DARPAstar: Multi-Robot Coverage Path Planning with Dynamic Obstacles

This repository implements a **Robust DARPA* algorithm** for multi-robot coverage path planning in environments with static and dynamic obstacles. It includes benchmarking tools and visualization of coverage performance.

---

## ðŸš€ Features
- Multi-robot coverage path planning using robust DARPA*.
- Handles both **static and dynamic obstacles**.
- Automatic benchmarking on different grid sizes, robot counts, and obstacle densities.
- Generates **plots and CSV logs** for reproducibility.
- Supports visualization (via `pygame`).
